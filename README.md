## 410 Obsolete Repository

You want [LiteGap for iOS]((https://github.com/couchbaselabs/LiteGap) and the [wiki article on building a Couchbase Lite PhoneGap container](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/LiteGap/wiki/Building-a-PhoneGap-Couchbase-Lite-Container)

# These are not the codes you are looking for

We've made a ton of progress on Couchbase Mobile technologies since this repository was current. You can find the latest code in these Github projects:

* [Couchbase Mobile](https://github.com/couchbase/mobile) documentation repository. Look here for an architecture overview, tutorials, and links to API docs.
* [Couchbase Lite iOS](https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-lite-ios) sync client. This is the latest version of [TouchDB](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/TouchDB-iOS). We've changed the name because it is lighter, and built by Couchbase. TouchDB will continue to get bug fixes but new development is happening on Couchbase Lite.
* **Couchbase Lite Android** is coming soon. If you need something for Android today, look at [TouchDB for Android](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/TouchDB-Android)
* [LiteGap iOS](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/LiteGap) PhoneGap / Cordova container for Couchbase Lite, makes it easy to build HTML5 mobile sync apps. If you are creating a PhoneGap container on Android, it should be as simple as adding TouchDB Android to the generic PhoneGap Android app.
